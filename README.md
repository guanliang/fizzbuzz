Requirements in stage 2 throws out some uncertainties which are integers that contains one number (3 or 5) but can be
divided by the other (5 or 3). For example, 35 can be divided by 5 and contains 3, whether its output is fizz or buzz is
then purely determined by which condition check takes priority which is not mentioned in the requirements. In that case,
the output maybe different when line 4 and 5 of fizzbuzz.rb are swapped.

One more thing.

Please do not feel surprised that my github account is almost empty. I do not use Github for all my private projects for
privacy and security reasons (I have my own server for that), and all my previous works are within each individual company's
git accounts.
